# Portfolio
- A central location to display and easily access all of my projects.

[Live site!](https://github.com/mmonyok/portfolio)

## Project Description
- Having a central location to highlight all of one's career accomplishments in a concise, aesthetically pleasing manner is key to networking and advancing throughout your career.
- I built this portfolio for two reasons. 1) I wanted to give more visual appeal to the array of projects I have completed. 2) It is faster and more simplified to give out my portfolio address, with links to all of my projects and networking sites, then to tell someone to check out my LinkedIn or my GitHub account. It makes me, as a potential employee, more accessible.
- This project helped me to solidy my current knowledge of HTML and CSS, as well as learn how to better troubleshoot issues that came up during more complex html and CSS that I had encountered previously.
